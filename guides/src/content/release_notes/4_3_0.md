## Overview


## Major/New Features

### Platform API

New set of fast and modern APIs for application to application integrations based on oAuth 2.0 authentication and permissions.
This API completely replaces API v1 which will be extracted from Spree core in 5.0. Platform API is built on the same 
foundations and technology as [Storefront API](https://api.spreecommerce.org/docs/api-v2/api/docs/v2/storefront/index.yaml) 
that means JSON API format, Swagger (Open API) documentation and oAuth 2.0 authentication.

Platform API is the biggest and most robust API for Spree with the biggest number of API endpoints to cover all features
available in Admin Panel plus more. All API v1 usage in Admin Panel was also replaced with Platform API.
